10/02 19:35:21: Using the compiler: g++
10/02 19:35:21: We are working with 1 file and 140 different types
10/02 19:35:21: The expectation is 11 digits.
10/02 19:35:21: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/02 19:35:42: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/02 19:35:45: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/02 19:44:20: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/02 19:46:43: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/02 19:46:46: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/02 19:46:46: The final result contains 100x double, 13x float and 27x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
