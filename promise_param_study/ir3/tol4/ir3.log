10/02 18:24:51: Using the compiler: g++
10/02 18:24:51: We are working with 1 file and 140 different types
10/02 18:24:51: The expectation is 11 digits.
10/02 18:24:51: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/02 18:25:14: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/02 18:25:17: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/02 18:33:36: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/02 18:35:26: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/02 18:35:29: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/02 18:35:29: The final result contains 101x double, 12x float and 27x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
