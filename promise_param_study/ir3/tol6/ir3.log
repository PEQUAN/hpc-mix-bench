10/02 19:13:36: Using the compiler: g++
10/02 19:13:36: We are working with 1 file and 140 different types
10/02 19:13:36: The expectation is 11 digits.
10/02 19:13:36: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/02 19:13:57: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/02 19:14:00: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/02 19:22:28: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/02 19:25:21: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/02 19:25:24: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/02 19:25:24: The final result contains 101x double, 18x float and 21x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
