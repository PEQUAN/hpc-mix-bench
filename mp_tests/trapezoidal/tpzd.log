11/16 03:43:27: Using the compiler: g++
11/16 03:43:27: We are working with 1 file and 54 different types
11/16 03:43:27: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/16 03:43:27: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/16 03:43:30: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/16 03:43:31: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/16 03:45:48: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/16 03:45:49: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/16 03:45:49: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/16 03:45:50: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/16 03:45:50: The final result contains 43x double and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
