11/21 10:40:10: Using the compiler: g++
11/21 10:40:10: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/21 10:40:10: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/21 10:40:10: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/21 10:40:13: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/21 10:40:13: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/21 10:42:05: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/21 10:42:06: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/21 10:42:06: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/21 10:42:07: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/21 10:42:07: The final result contains 57x double and 1x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
