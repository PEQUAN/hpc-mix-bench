11/27 01:54:59: Using the compiler: g++
11/27 01:54:59: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/27 01:54:59: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/27 01:54:59: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/27 01:55:01: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/27 01:55:02: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/27 01:56:55: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/27 01:56:56: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/27 01:56:56: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/27 01:56:56: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/27 01:56:56: The final result contains 57x double and 1x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
