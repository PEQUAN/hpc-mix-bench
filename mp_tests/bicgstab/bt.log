11/21 13:32:23: We are working with 1 file and 114 different types
11/21 13:32:23: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/21 13:32:23: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/21 13:32:27: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/21 13:32:29: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/21 13:37:14: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/21 13:37:49: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/21 13:37:51: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/21 13:37:51: The final result contains 97x double, 3x float and 14x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
