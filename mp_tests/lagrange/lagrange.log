11/21 09:48:42: Using the compiler: g++
11/21 09:48:42: We are working with 1 file and 20 different types
11/21 09:48:42: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/21 09:48:42: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/21 09:48:44: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/21 09:48:45: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/21 09:49:30: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/21 09:49:31: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/21 09:49:31: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/21 09:49:33: The final result contains 18x double, 1x flx::floatx<8, 7> and 1x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
