11/16 03:40:54: Using the compiler: g++
11/16 03:40:54: We are working with 1 file and 46 different types
11/16 03:40:54: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/16 03:40:54: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/16 03:40:56: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/16 03:40:57: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/16 03:43:12: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/16 03:43:13: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/16 03:43:13: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/16 03:43:14: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/16 03:43:14: The final result contains 35x double and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
