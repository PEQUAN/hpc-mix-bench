11/21 12:12:03: Using the compiler: g++
11/21 12:12:03: We are working with 1 file and 32 different types
11/21 12:12:03: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/21 12:12:03: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/21 12:12:08: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/21 12:12:10: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/21 12:13:26: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/21 12:13:27: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/21 12:13:27: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/21 12:13:29: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/21 12:13:29: The final result contains 28x double and 4x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
