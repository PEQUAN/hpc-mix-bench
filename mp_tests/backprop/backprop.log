11/27 01:48:57: Using the compiler: g++
11/27 01:48:57: We are working with 5 files and 16 different types
11/27 01:48:57: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/27 01:48:57: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/27 01:49:08: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/27 01:49:11: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/27 01:50:39: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/27 01:51:26: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/27 01:51:29: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/27 01:51:29: The final result contains 6x double, 2x float and 8x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
