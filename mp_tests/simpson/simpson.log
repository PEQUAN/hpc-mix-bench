11/21 10:45:37: Using the compiler: g++
11/21 10:45:37: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/21 10:45:37: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/21 10:45:37: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/21 10:45:40: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/21 10:45:41: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/21 10:47:49: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/21 10:47:49: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/21 10:47:49: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/21 10:47:50: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/21 10:47:50: The final result contains 47x double and 11x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
