11/27 02:42:17: Using the compiler: g++
11/27 02:42:17: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/27 02:42:17: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/27 02:42:17: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/27 02:42:20: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/27 02:42:21: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/27 02:44:27: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/27 02:44:28: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/27 02:44:28: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/27 02:44:29: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/27 02:44:29: The final result contains 47x double and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
