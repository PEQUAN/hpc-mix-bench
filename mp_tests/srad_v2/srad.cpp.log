12/02 15:57:15: Using the compiler: g++
12/02 15:57:15: We are working with 1 file and 11 different types
12/02 15:57:15: The expectation is 10 digits.
12/02 15:57:15: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
12/02 15:58:02: b) Check with highest format (Double)
12/02 15:58:34: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
12/02 16:03:02: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
12/02 16:03:35: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
12/02 16:03:35: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
12/02 16:04:08: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
12/02 16:04:08: The final result contains 10x double and 1x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
