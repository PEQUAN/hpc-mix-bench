11/27 02:13:13: Using the compiler: g++
11/27 02:13:13: We are working with 1 file and 31 different types
11/27 02:13:13: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/27 02:13:13: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/27 02:13:19: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/27 02:13:22: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/27 02:14:18: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/27 02:16:11: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/27 02:16:14: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/27 02:16:14: The final result contains 13x double, 4x float and 14x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
