06/04 17:28:48: Using the compiler: g++
06/04 17:28:48: We are working with 1 file and 66 different types
06/04 17:28:48: The expectation is 8 digits.
06/04 17:28:48: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/04 17:28:52: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/04 17:28:53: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/04 17:30:37: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
06/04 17:32:22: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
06/04 17:32:23: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
06/04 17:32:23: f) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/04 17:32:24: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
06/04 17:32:24: g) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/04 17:32:25: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/04 17:32:25: The final result contains 24x double, 31x float and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
