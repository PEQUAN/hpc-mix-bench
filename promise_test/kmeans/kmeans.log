06/10 13:28:56: Using the compiler: g++
06/10 13:28:56: We are working with 1 file and 66 different types
06/10 13:28:56: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/10 13:28:56: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/10 13:31:49: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/10 13:31:50: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/10 13:33:33: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
06/10 13:35:19: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/Half
06/10 13:35:20: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
06/10 13:35:20: f) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/10 13:35:21: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/10 13:35:21: The final result contains 24x double, 31x float and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
