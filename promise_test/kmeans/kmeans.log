06/28 08:13:09: We are working with 1 file and 66 different types
06/28 08:13:09: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/28 08:13:09: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/28 08:13:13: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/28 08:13:14: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/28 08:15:01: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/28 08:16:05: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/28 08:16:06: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
06/28 08:16:06: The final result contains 24x double, 11x float and 31x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
