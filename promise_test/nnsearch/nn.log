07/01 00:03:19: Using the compiler: g++
07/01 00:03:19: We are working with 1 file and 17 different types
07/01 00:03:19: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/01 00:03:19: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/01 00:03:21: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/01 00:03:22: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/01 00:04:05: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/01 00:04:06: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
07/01 00:04:06: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/01 00:04:07: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/01 00:04:07: The final result contains 16x double and 1x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
