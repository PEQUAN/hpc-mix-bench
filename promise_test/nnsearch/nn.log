06/26 10:46:16: Using the compiler: g++
06/26 10:46:16: We are working with 1 file and 17 different types
06/26 10:46:16: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/26 10:46:16: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/26 10:46:19: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/26 10:46:20: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/26 10:47:05: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/26 10:47:06: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
06/26 10:47:06: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/26 10:47:07: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
06/26 10:47:07: The final result contains 16x double and 1x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
