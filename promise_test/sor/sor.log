06/10 14:10:17: Using the compiler: g++
06/10 14:10:17: We are working with 1 file and 53 different types
06/10 14:10:17: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/10 14:10:17: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/10 14:10:20: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/10 14:10:21: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/10 14:12:27: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/10 14:13:46: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/10 14:14:30: f) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/10 14:14:31: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/10 14:14:31: The final result contains 38x double, 4x float, 4x flx::floatx<8, 7> and 7x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
