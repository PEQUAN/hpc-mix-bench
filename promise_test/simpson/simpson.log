07/17 21:10:36: We are working with 1 file and 78 different types
07/17 21:10:36: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/17 21:10:36: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/17 21:10:52: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/17 21:10:54: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/17 21:14:59: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/17 21:15:24: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/17 21:15:28: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/17 21:15:28: The final result contains 57x double, 1x float and 20x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
