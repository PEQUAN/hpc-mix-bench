06/04 17:57:36: Using the compiler: g++
06/04 17:57:36: We are working with 1 file and 51 different types
06/04 17:57:36: The expectation is 8 digits.
06/04 17:57:36: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/04 17:57:39: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/04 17:57:40: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/04 17:59:51: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
06/04 18:00:27: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
06/04 18:00:28: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
06/04 18:00:28: f) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/04 18:00:29: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
06/04 18:00:29: g) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/04 18:00:30: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/04 18:00:30: The final result contains 35x double, 11x float and 5x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
