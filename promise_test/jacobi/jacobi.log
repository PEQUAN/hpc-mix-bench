06/10 13:53:08: Using the compiler: g++
06/10 13:53:08: We are working with 1 file and 51 different types
06/10 13:53:08: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/10 13:53:08: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/10 13:53:11: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/10 13:53:12: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/10 13:55:22: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/10 13:56:42: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/10 13:57:28: f) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/10 13:57:30: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/10 13:57:30: The final result contains 35x double, 4x float, 4x flx::floatx<8, 7> and 8x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
