06/04 11:40:13: The expectation is 5 digits.
06/04 11:40:13: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/04 11:40:17: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/04 11:40:19: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/04 11:42:47: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
06/04 11:43:10: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
06/04 11:43:11: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
06/04 11:43:11: The final result contains 46x double, 14x float and 2x flx::floatx<8, 7>.
