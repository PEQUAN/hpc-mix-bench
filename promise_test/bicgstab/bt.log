05/15 12:43:26: The expectation is 5 digits.
05/15 12:43:26: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
05/15 12:43:30: b) Check with highest format (Double)
05/15 12:43:31: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
05/15 12:45:56: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
05/15 12:46:19: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
05/15 12:46:20: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
05/15 12:46:20: The final result contains 46x double, 14x float and 2x flx::floatx<8, 7>.
