07/18 12:47:20: We are working with 1 file and 66 different types
07/18 12:47:20: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/18 12:47:20: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/18 12:47:49: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/18 12:47:52: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/18 12:51:41: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/18 12:52:07: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/18 12:52:12: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/18 12:52:12: The final result contains 43x double, 1x float and 22x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
