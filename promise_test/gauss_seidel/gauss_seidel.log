06/10 12:16:11: Using the compiler: g++
06/10 12:16:11: We are working with 1 file and 34 different types
06/10 12:16:11: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/10 12:16:11: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/10 12:16:17: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/10 12:16:18: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/10 12:17:56: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/10 12:18:04: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/10 12:19:17: f) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/10 12:19:19: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/10 12:19:19: The final result contains 25x double, 2x float, 4x flx::floatx<8, 7> and 3x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
