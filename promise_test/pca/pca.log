06/30 09:49:52: Using the compiler: g++
06/30 09:49:52: We are working with 1 file and 49 different types
06/30 09:49:52: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/30 09:49:52: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/30 09:49:55: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/30 09:49:56: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/30 09:51:31: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/30 09:51:50: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
06/30 09:51:51: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/30 09:51:51: The final result contains 27x double, 5x float and 17x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
