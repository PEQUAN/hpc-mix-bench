06/26 10:52:49: Using the compiler: g++
06/26 10:52:49: We are working with 1 file and 16 different types
06/26 10:52:49: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/26 10:52:49: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/26 10:52:53: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/26 10:52:55: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/26 10:53:40: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/26 10:53:48: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/26 10:53:49: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
06/26 10:53:49: The final result contains 13x double, 1x float and 2x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
