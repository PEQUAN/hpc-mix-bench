03/30 23:14:28: Using the compiler: g++
03/30 23:14:28: We are working with 1 file and 18 different types
03/30 23:14:28: The expectation is 12 digits.
03/30 23:14:28: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
03/30 23:14:32: b) Check with highest format (Double)
03/30 23:14:33: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
03/30 23:14:52: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
03/30 23:15:25: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
03/30 23:15:27: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
03/30 23:15:27: The final result contains 2x double, 12x float and 4x flx::floatx<8, 7>.
