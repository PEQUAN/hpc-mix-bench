06/10 12:58:03: Using the compiler: g++
06/10 12:58:03: We are working with 1 file and 47 different types
06/10 12:58:03: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/10 12:58:03: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/10 12:58:08: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/10 12:58:09: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/10 13:00:12: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/10 13:00:20: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/10 13:00:47: f) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/10 13:00:48: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/10 13:00:48: The final result contains 36x double, 1x float, 5x flx::floatx<8, 7> and 5x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
