05/01 00:06:01: Using the compiler: g++
05/01 00:06:01: We are working with 1 file and 13 different types
05/01 00:06:01: The expectation is 14 digits.
05/01 00:06:01: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
05/01 00:06:05: b) Check with highest format (Double)
05/01 00:06:07: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
05/01 00:06:32: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
05/01 00:06:45: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
05/01 00:06:47: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
05/01 00:06:47: The final result contains 5x double, 7x float and 1x flx::floatx<8, 7>.
