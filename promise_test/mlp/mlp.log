03/30 23:31:56: Using the compiler: g++
03/30 23:31:56: We are working with 1 file and 39 different types
03/30 23:31:56: The expectation is 12 digits.
03/30 23:31:56: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
03/30 23:32:01: b) Check with highest format (Double)
03/30 23:32:03: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
03/30 23:32:05: The format float is enough for your expectation
03/30 23:32:05: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
03/30 23:33:53: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
03/30 23:33:55: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
03/30 23:33:55: The final result contains 34x float and 5x flx::floatx<8, 7>.
