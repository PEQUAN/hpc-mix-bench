07/17 21:27:27: Using the compiler: g++
07/17 21:27:27: We are working with 1 file and 90 different types
07/17 21:27:27: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/17 21:27:27: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/17 21:29:06: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/17 21:29:13: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/17 21:36:38: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/17 22:16:12: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/17 22:16:34: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/17 22:16:34: The final result contains 20x double, 11x float and 59x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
