06/10 15:50:27: Using the compiler: g++
06/10 15:50:27: We are working with 1 file and 56 different types
06/10 15:50:27: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/10 15:50:27: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/10 15:50:30: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/10 15:50:31: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/10 15:54:03: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/10 15:54:09: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 5)/bfloat16
06/10 15:54:10: The format flx::floatx<5, 5> is enough for your expectation
06/10 15:54:10: f) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(5, 5)
06/10 15:54:29: The final result contains 49x double, 2x float, 1x flx::floatx<5, 5> and 4x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
