06/29 18:39:50: Using the compiler: g++
06/29 18:39:50: We are working with 1 file and 90 different types
06/29 18:39:50: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/29 18:39:50: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/29 18:40:23: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/29 18:40:26: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/29 18:46:21: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/29 18:46:25: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
06/29 18:46:25: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
06/29 18:47:19: The final result contains 83x double, 3x flx::floatx<8, 7> and 4x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
