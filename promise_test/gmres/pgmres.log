09/18 22:12:15: Using the compiler: g++
09/18 22:12:15: We are working with 1 file and 90 different types
09/18 22:12:15: The expectation is 10 digits.
09/18 22:12:15: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
09/18 22:12:48: b) Check with highest format (Double)
09/18 22:12:51: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
09/18 22:18:49: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
09/18 22:18:53: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
09/18 22:18:53: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
09/18 22:19:47: The final result contains 83x double, 3x flx::floatx<8, 7> and 4x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
