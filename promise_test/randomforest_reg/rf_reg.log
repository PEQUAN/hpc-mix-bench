06/10 14:58:14: Using the compiler: g++
06/10 14:58:14: We are working with 1 file and 47 different types
06/10 14:58:14: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/10 14:58:14: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/10 14:58:27: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/10 14:58:28: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/10 15:00:34: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/10 15:02:35: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/10 15:02:57: f) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/custom(4, 3)
06/10 15:03:05: The final result contains 24x double, 11x float, 3x flx::floatx<8, 7>, 1x flx::floatx<4, 3> and 8x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
